# Gatsby Minimalist Starter

This starter is for developers who prefer a more blank slate than the `gatsby-default-starter` provides, but has some additional helpers when it comes to making initial design decisions. Features include:

-Initial setup for [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)

-A leaner `layout.css` that also has a small checklist to assist with initial scales for whatever design system you're implementing.

# Getting Started

- `git clone git@github.com:dylanesque/Gatsby-Minimalist-Starter.git`
- `cd Gatsby-Minimalist-Starter`
- `yarn install && gatsby develop`
